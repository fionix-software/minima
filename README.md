# Minima

Minima is a minimal iCress application. Minima name is picked to be an alternative name for Lumos. In Harry Potter series, there is a spell called 'Lumos Maxima' which is the incantation to a charm that can be used to produce a blinding flash of bright white light from the tip of the wand. As an alternative, the Minima is the opposite for Maxima. Why picked the spell? Well, there is an existing iCress application at early time called 'Lumos' which was discontinued.

Its initial development is on 5 Mar 2017 and was first published on 6 Mar 2017. Minima will be migrated to Flutter starts from version 4.0.0, released on 10 May 2020 but opted-out starting version 4.1.0 in favour of Kotlin due to lot of request to up the native version. Minima native will do tons of improvement and fixes. With this, Minima will be divided into two: Minima (Android native using Kotlin) and [Minima-X](https://github.com/fionix-software/minima-x) (cross platform using Flutter).
