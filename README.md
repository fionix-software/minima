# Minima

Minima is a minimal iCress application. Minima name is picked to be an alternative name for Lumos. In Harry Potter series, there is a spell called 'Lumos Maxima' which is the incantation to a charm that can be used to produce a blinding flash of bright white light from the tip of the wand. As an alternative, the Minima is the opposite for Maxima. Why picked the spell? Well, there is an existing iCress application at early time called 'Lumos' which was discontinued.

Minima will be migrated to Flutter starts from version 4.0.0, released on 10 May 2020. Its initial development is on 5 Mar 2017 and was first published on 6 Mar 2017. Minima migration will start its development soon. However, Minima will revive old Minima using Kotlin programming language starting version 4.1.0 with tons of improvement and fixes. With this, Minima will have two type: Minima native (using Kotlin) and Minima cross-platform (using Flutter). Minima native will get main support from developer while Minima cross-platform will just be maintained as it is.

What is open source and why? Open-source software (OSS) is a type of computer software in which source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source software embrace strong values of community, collaboration, and transparency, for the mutual benefit of the platform and its users. Other than that, it is more cost-effective, flexible, and secure.
