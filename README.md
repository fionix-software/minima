# Minima

Minima is a minimal cross platform iCress application. Minima name is picked to be an alternative name for Lumos. In Harry Potter series, there is a spell called 'Lumos Maxima' which is the incantation to a charm that can be used to produce a blinding flash of bright white light from the tip of the wand. As an alternative, the Minima is the opposite for Maxima. Why picked the spell? Well, there is an existing iCress application at early time called 'Lumos' which was discontinued.

Minima will be migrated to Flutter starts from version 4. Its initial development is on 5 Mar 2017 and was first published on 6 Mar 2017. Minima migration will start its development soon.

This application uses Flutter framework and Dart programming language to ensure compatibility across multiple platform. Flutter is Googleâ€™s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

What is open source and why? Open-source software (OSS) is a type of computer software in which source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source software embrace strong values of community, collaboration, and transparency, for the mutual benefit of the platform and its users. Other than that, it is more cost-effective, flexible, and secure.

# Convention and branching

Flutter already have implemented effective code style checker, which means less human job in standardizing the code style. For now, the only exceptions are stated as below:
- Disable dartfmt's line length by set it to value 0

However, implementation of design patterns and best practices in the source code is welcome but make sure it do more benefit than do harm.

Branching format is **type**/**change-title**. Type is only applicable to feature and fix. Pull request is considered a feature branch. Make sure your title consists of 2 to 5 word sentence. The title should be clear and meaningful. Use '-' to substitute the space between word, and not '\_'. Branch name should be singular for both type and change title.
